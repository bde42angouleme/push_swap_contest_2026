# Description
Push swap is a project in which you must sort a list of numbers provided by the user using two linked lists and a limited number of operations.
I use a chunck algorithm inspire by butterfly but with previous research with other algorithm like one inspired by the insertion sort who move to tree sort.
This project learn us algorithm skill.

# Instructions
To use this programme, run the following command at the root of the project.
```bash
make
```
This will create an executable file called `push_swap`, which can be used as follows:
```bash
./push_swap 5 6 9 7 8 2 4
```
Or

```bash
./push_swap 5 "     6 -9 "   +7
```

# Resources
For this project, I enlisted the help of other students at 42 and drew on my knowledge of sorting algorithms.
I don't use IA for this project.
